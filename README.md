<h1>Car Analysis SQL Project</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This project involves analyzing the fuel type distribution across four major car brands: Audi, BMW, Hyundai, and Mercedes. The goal is to understand the prevalence of different fuel types within each brand and compare them to see if any patterns or trends emerge. The analysis is conducted using SQL to aggregate and join data from different tables representing each car brand.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This analysis provides a comprehensive view of the fuel type distribution across four major car brands. By leveraging SQL, we were able to effectively aggregate and compare the data. The findings can help manufacturers and marketers understand market trends and consumer preferences for different fuel types within each brand.</p>
